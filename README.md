# StudentSphere: ERP Portal for Students

## Overview

StudentSphere is a comprehensive Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) portal built using Java Object-Oriented Programming principles. The ERP portal is a comprehensive platform that enables students to access academic information, manage profiles, interact with faculty, and perform various administrative tasks. This project endeavors to recreate the portal's functionalities and user interface to provide a similar experience for educational purposes.

## Project Objective

The primary goal of StudentSphere is to create a simulated environment for students to practice using ERP functionalities. By replicating essential features of ERP systems commonly used in educational institutions, students can enhance their programming skills and gain practical experience in software development.
