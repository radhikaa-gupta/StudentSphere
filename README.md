# StudentSphere: ERP Portal for Students

## Overview

StudentSphere is a comprehensive Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) portal built using Java Object-Oriented Programming principles. It provides students with a centralized platform to manage academic activities, access information, and communicate with faculty.

## Project Objective

The primary goal of StudentSphere is to create a simulated environment for students to practice using ERP functionalities. By replicating essential features of ERP systems commonly used in educational institutions, students can enhance their programming skills and gain practical experience in software development.
